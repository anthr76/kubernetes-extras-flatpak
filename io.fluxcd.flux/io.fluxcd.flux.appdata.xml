		<p>
			Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with 
			sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating 
			updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.
			Flux version 2 ("v2") is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes' 
			API extension system, and to integrate with Prometheus and other core 
			components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. In version 2, Flux supports 
			multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of 
			Git repositories, among other long-requested features.
